//! Active Priorities Registers, `GICH_APR<n>`, n = 0 - 3
//! The `GICH_APR<n>` characteristics are:
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! These registers track which preemption levels are active in the virtual CPU interface, and indicate the current active priority.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! This register is present only when FEAT_GICv3_LEGACY is implemented and EL2 is implemented. Otherwise, direct accesses to `GICH_APR<n>` are RES0.
//!
//! This register is available when the GIC implementation supports interrupt virtualization.
//!
//! The number of registers required depends on how many bits are implemented in `GICH_LR<n>.Priority`:
//! - When 5 priority bits are implemented, 1 register is required (GICH_APR0).
//! - When 6 priority bits are implemented, 2 registers are required (GICH_APR0, GICH_APR1).
//! - When 7 priority bits are implemented, 4 registers are required (GICH_APR0, GICH_APR1, GICH_APR2, GICH_APR3).
//!   Unimplemented registers are RAZ/WI.
//!
//! ## Attributes
//!
//! `GICH_APR<n>` is a 32-bit register.
